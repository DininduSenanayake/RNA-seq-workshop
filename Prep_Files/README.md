# Workshop Preparation

Things to check:
- Are you able to login into NeSI (If not please get in touch with Dini - dinindu.senanayake@nesi.org.nz)
- Do you have RStudio installed on your laptop

Once you login to NeSI, you will see a folder RNA_seq in your home directory:

```
$ cd RNA_seq

$ ls -F
Genome/ Raw/

```

If you see the RNA_seq directory with 2 sub-directories: Genome/ and Raw/, yayyy you are good to go.

If not, no pressure, we can still copy the RNA_seq directory to your home directory.

```
$ cp -r /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/RNA_seq/ /home/Your_Username

$ ls
RNA_seq

```
